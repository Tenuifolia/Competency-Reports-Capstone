Competency Assessment Result Management Authority (C.A.R.M.A.)

Description

This program makes monitoring and maintaining employee competency assessments a simple reality for management within a growing company. This program has two main portals. The first will allow users to access their own assessment results for competency assessment tests that they’ve taken, as well as edit their own contact information. The second portal is for managers, and they have much more extensive access with more functions available to them.  Managers can add or edit users, assessments, competencies, and assessment results. Managers can also delete assessment results, or deactivate employees that are no longer with the company as well as reactivate them. A large part of meeting the manager’s needs will be found in the reports function. Here managers can view competency reports based on the specific user, or all results for a specific competency assessment.  Finally managers will be able to export whole tables from the database, including the Users table and the Competencies table, and even upload entire lists of Assessments Results in a CSV file format. We hope this program will make monitoring and maintaining employee competency assessments an easy possibility. 

Usage
This program is accessible through a simple Command Line Interface.  Now don’t let that interface type intimidate you. The easy to use, straightforward functionality of this software will give you all the prompts and instructions for the expected inputs and walk you through getting the information you need.  You’ll simply sign in using your email address as the Username, as well as your employee password, then follow the expressive menu prompts that give numbered recommendations for how to select a menu.  The avid user may also take advantage of the intuitive hotkey options also available to quickly navigate the menus. 

Roadmap
This software is in its infant stages, and was created with no time to spare. Future renditions of the software will include organized coding which is less likely to attract ax murderers to my home.

Authors and acknowledgment
The sole author of this software is Michael Alder.  However, none of this would have been possible without the teaching and guidance of the dedicated teachers and staff at DevPipeline. Thank you to those teachers and fellow classmates for getting me here.
